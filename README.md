README
A code for retrieving Kepler/K2 (I actually didn't test Kepler I only used K2 stars :-) ) star data and analyzing RR Lyrae stars using Lomb-Scargle, AoV, Fourier, then plotting them together on matplotlib. 
I attempted to implement Gaia and AAVSO datasets, but was unsuccessful.
Package requirements: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, astropy, astroquery, scipy, lightkurve. Requests and warnings should be preinstalled.
